Things to consider:
-Do I want to have a blog section. What wound the posts be?
-- Use my favorite writings as sections in website blog
-Do I just want to make an IG so it's a photo blog? I currently don't have enough photos.
-Do I want to write, long extensive things? No. I would rather write small blurbs about daily occurrence.
-Places I’ve Been - map scratch off
-Good books (goodreads widget) / movies (imdb widget) / articles (?) / podcasts
-Travel stories
