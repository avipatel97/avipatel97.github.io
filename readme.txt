Things to consider:
-Change this file name to Release Notes?
-Do I want to have a blog section. What wound the posts be?
-Do I just want to make an IG so its a photo blog. No, because I then would be concerned over likes/comments instead of the content itself.
-Do I want to write, long extensive things? No. I would rather write small blurbs about daily occurance.
Ex. -One photo of interracial marriage and my interracial blurbs
Ex. -One photo of india and my thoughts on that place
Ex. -One photo of formal education and my thoughts on that place
Ex. -Image that sums of conversation with param. My thoughts on that place.
Ex. -Image of whitney. My thoughts on why we do this dumb stuff.
Ex. -

-Travel stories
-Good books / movies / articles (Goodreads) / podcasts
