Things to do:
-Change this file name to Release Notes?
-Decide if I want to have a blog section. What wound the posts be?
-Do I just want to make an IG so its a photo blog. No, because I then would be concerned over likes/comments instead of the content itself.
-Do I want to write, long extensive things? No. I would rather write small blurbs about daily occurance.
Ex. -One photo of interracial marriage and my interracial blurbs
Ex. -One photo of india and my thoughts on that place
