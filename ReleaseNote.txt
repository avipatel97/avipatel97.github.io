Things to consider:
-Do I want to have a blog section. What wound the posts be?
-Do I just want to make an IG so its a photo blog. No, because I then would be concerned over likes/comments instead of the content itself.
-Do I want to write, long extensive things? No. I would rather write small blurbs about daily occurrence.
-Places Iâ€™ve Been - map scratch off
-Good books (goodreads widget) / movies (imdb widget) / articles (?) / podcasts
-Sample Blog Post: One photo of interracial marriage and my interracial blurbs
-Sample Blog Post: One photo of India and my thoughts on that place
-Sample Blog Post: One photo of formal education and my thoughts on that place
-Sample Blog Post: Image that sums up conversation with P. My thoughts on that place.
-Sample Blog Post: Image of Whitney. My thoughts on why we do this dumb stuff.
